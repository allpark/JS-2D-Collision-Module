These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Installing

To install this module, drop and include the following files into your project: 
1. collision.js

### Functions 

#### hullVertsIntersect
##### Description

Performs an intersection test on two axis-aligned hulls (which contain an array of vertices in clockwise order)
##### Usage
> hullVertsIntersect(bb0, bb1)

##### Parameters

bb0 A 2D array of two min max points which form a box

bb1 A 2D array of two min max points which form a box
